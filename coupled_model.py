#   alpha  : how much the deep baseline matters. alpha=0 -> fast-forcing-only
#            (the NULL model EVT-01 must beat). This is the load-bearing knob.

# Hook: emits the same structured timeseries the earth-systems-physics cascade
# engine ingests as a lithosphere/hydrosphere boundary forcing.
