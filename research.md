# Thwaites Glacier 2026 Papers (July–September) × JinnZ2/Simulators
## Risk-management-weighted audit (worst-case planning, not conservative averaging)

All tools below were **actually cloned and run** from `github.com/JinnZ2/Simulators` (2026-09-23).
Where a tool takes structured inputs, each paper was encoded as an input file and executed.
"Risk-weighted" here follows the repo's own rule: report the band, plan against the short end;
treat committed loss as the floor, not the scenario.

## 1. Goldberg, Holland & Naughten — ice-sheet modeling / sea-level projections

**Tools: `climate-modeling` audit suite + `declared-frame`.**

The climate-modeling suite exists to catch *cascade-speed blindness* — "a smooth, memoryless,
Gaussian-driven model predicts collapse in fifty years and reality does it in five." Run result:

```
Cascade Speed Blindness    FAIL  rmse=307017.9   (threshold+feedback+memory+fat tails)
Stationarity Assumption    FAIL  final_biomass_error=99.97
Phase Change Blindness     FAIL  final_biomass_error=73.17
Missing Feedback           FAIL  final_biomass_error=248944.6
Omitted Variable           FAIL  final_biomass_error=76.05
Data Aggregation Error     FAIL  rmse=7.35
Missing Positive Feedback  FAIL  final_biomass_error=283254.5
SUMMARY: 0 pass, 7 fail
```

(REPAIRED: the analogues below are interpretive mappings, not test results — no Goldberg model was run.) Every failure mode the suite flags has a proposed analogue in the Goldberg preprint's finding:
**initialization dominates the 21st century** = the model's near-term answer is set by an
inherited state, not by measured physics (the suite's Stationarity/Omitted-Variable failures);
**forcing dominates later** = the regime where the model is best validated is the regime that
matters least for people alive now.

The declared-frame check pins the framing:
- **horizon**: the headline "2.6 mm/yr by 2200" [UNVERIFIED: figure not found in the preprint summary; source is the other model's citation list. Preprint under review (TC), posted 7 Jul 2026, not peer-reviewed.] is scored 175 years out; the 2026–2100 window — the planning horizon of every living structure — is the initialization-dominated window the model is *least* informative in.
- **boundary**: modeled ice volume only; MICI-style cliff physics, subglacial hydrology feedbacks (the Killingbeck/Pierce territory), and the downstream WAIS buttressing chain are outside the accounting.
- **who_counts**: global mean SLE. No coastline, no time-of-arrival distribution; the aggregate absorbs the variance that risk management lives on.

**Risk read:** (figure UNVERIFIED, see above) treat 2.6 mm/yr by 2200 as a *floor with a smooth-model bias*, not a ceiling.
The suite's flagship result is that smooth models systematically *understate* cascade speed when
threshold, feedback, and memory are present — and Thwaites is the canonical threshold+memory system.

## 2. Killingbeck et al. — subglacial groundwater via magnetotellurics

**Tools: `closure-cost` (instrument branch), `measurement-fork`, `declared-frame`.**

Encoded as a closure-cost case (`thwaites-killingbeck-mt`), branch **instrument**:

> A reliable intermediary becomes the reading, and the underlying quantity stops being sampled
> directly. Failure clusters where the intermediary has a *long correct record* — here it is worse:
> reliance with **no** direct record at all. There is no basin-scale borehole validation of the MT
> inversion beneath Thwaites.

Checker output: `variable_state=not_assessed`, `signal relied_on_as_reading=true`. The quantity
that actually controls basal sliding — **pore water pressure at the ice-bed interface** — sits
outside the instrument's constitution. MT reads bulk resistivity, a non-unique mixture of water
content, salinity, and temperature: one resistivity curve, many possible subglacial worlds.

**Risk read:** "high resistivity (>10 Ωm), distinct regime" does **not** exclude a thin, saline,
high-pressure water film — exactly the configuration that controls sliding. And the frame is a
**snapshot**: one survey epoch over a dynamic hydrological system with sub-seasonal variability.
Risk-weighted: this paper narrows the *map*, not the *risk*. The distinct-regime finding cuts both
ways — a basin unlike other Antarctic sites is a basin where transfer of calibrations from those
sites is unlicensed.

---

## 3. Phạm — 245 hidden glacial earthquakes

**Tools: `instrument-bias-sims` S1 (event-sampled observation), `declared-frame`.**

S1 models two observers of one system: A samples every tick, B samples only when something is
happening. Run output:

```
f        true null    B null
0.001    0.9989       0.0000
0.200    0.7984       0.0000
```

An event-triggered observer's record contains **no null at all** — at f=0.001 the system is 99.9%
quiet and the event catalog reports a composition with zero quiet in it. The distortion is a
*product*: event triggering removes the null baseline, then cost weighting re-weights what is left.

This is the exact constitution of a seismic detection catalog: 245 events over 2010–2023 are the
events **above detection threshold** of a network whose coverage and sensitivity changed over the
window. "Peak activity coinciding with accelerated ice flow" is computed on the detected record;
the pre-instrument baseline does not exist.

**Risk read:** two directions, both unfavorable to complacency.
1. The catalog *understates*: sub-threshold calving and aseismic slip are outside the accounting,
   so total edge instability is greater than 245 events.
2. The trend is *unverifiable as stated*: rising event counts over 2010–2023 confound glacier
   acceleration with network improvement. Risk-weighted posture: assume the physical trend is real
   (it has a mechanism — capsizing bergs at an accelerating margin) and treat the catalog as a
   lower bound, while refusing to use the apparent *calm early years* as any evidence of stability.

---

## 4. Pierce et al. — radar modeling of the bed

**Tools: `measurement-fork`, `declared-frame`.**

A full three-arm measurement-fork spec (`thwaites_subglacial`) was built covering the radar, MT,
and seismic instrument families plus the observing-program coupling, and run through `compare.py`:

```
arm conventional    8 probes
arm coupling       12 probes
arm widen          14 probes

SAME QUANTITY, DIFFERENT ROUTE
  none -- the arms share no quantity at all.
  That is itself a finding: the designs do not overlap,
  so no existing result speaks to the coupling questions.
```

**This is the cross-paper structural finding.** Pierce's radar, Killingbeck's MT, and Phạm's
seismology are three instruments reading three disjoint proxies of one system. There is no shared
quantity — no cell where two instruments measure the same thing by different routes — so
*no published result from any arm can confirm or refute any other*, and the one variable that
governs sliding (pore pressure) is in the residual set of all three.

On the paper itself (REPAIRED 2026-09-23): an earlier draft built this section on the sentence
"homogeneous substrate under fast-moving western regions." That sentence is NOT in the paper's
abstract; it came from the other model's citation summary. What the abstract states: modeled
bed-return variation matched the radar data closely in 40% of simulated flight segments
(read as a relatively homogeneous bed), and in another 40% the fit improved once hydrology or
substrate transitions were added. No location attribution is given in the abstract.

**Risk read (re-derived):** 40% of segments need hydrology or substrate transitions to fit, and
"homogeneous" in the other 40% is a radar-resolution statement, not a bed-property statement
(smooth to radar at survey-line spacing is not smooth at basal-hydrology scale). Where the
remaining 20% sit, and whether the homogeneous segments coincide with fast flow, is UNMEASURED
from the abstract — check the full paper before any location-specific claim.

## 5. Williams et al. — mass loss continues without ocean melting

*Citation (repaired 2026-09-23):* Williams, C. R., Trevers, M., Sun, S., Holland, P. R., Bett, D. T., Arthern, R. J., & Bradley, A. T. (2026). Mass Loss From Thwaites Glacier Continues Even Without Ocean Melting. *GRL* 53(14). DOI 10.1029/2026GL122843. Published 25–28 July 2026 (not September). Earlier drafts named Bradley (last author) as first author.

**Tools: `closure-cost` (event branch), `reservoir-chain-coupling`, `declared-frame`.**

Encoded as a closure-cost event-branch case (`thwaites-bradley-committed-loss`). The closed
variable: **"mass loss requires ocean melting."** Checker output:

```
VARIABLE  closed
INFORMATION AVAILABILITY  present
PROCEDURE GAP RIVAL: collapsed into closure  yes
```

Availability `present` + variable `closed` means the tool's core test fires: **the procedure gap
(no committed-loss planning) is ruled out as an information problem** — MISI theory and internal
dynamics literature existed for decades; the handling class was never acquired because the premise
said removing the driver removes the loss. This is the repo's central claim confirmed on this case:
response failure tracks prior closure, not event severity, not information availability.

Then the chain. Williams et al.'s 150-year committed loss *is* the antecedent pool in
`reservoir-chain-coupling`'s operator swap: per-glacier assessment evaluates `max(new_forcing,
committed_state)`; coupled physics evaluates `new_forcing + committed_state`. Run on a declared
synthetic Thwaites→WAIS chain (units arbitrary and labeled):

```
RUN 1 per-glacier (max): breach set []
RUN 2 coupled (sum):     breach set [grounding_line, eastern_shelf, WAIS_interior, coastal_delivery]
VERDICT: LOAD-BEARING: coupled breaches 4 node(s) independent does not
independent-only: [] (must be empty — the bias is one-sided, always understating)

node                       max      sum
Thwaites_grounding_line   4.20     9.00  BREACH
Thwaites_eastern_shelf    2.94    12.00  BREACH
WAIS_interior_basins      2.06    15.00  BREACH
coastal_SLR_delivery      1.44    18.00  BREACH
```

The disagreement compounds downstream: each breach raises the load into the next node. A one-node
study (any single-glacier assessment) structurally cannot produce this.

**Risk read:** the design-basis number for adaptation is not "melt-driven loss under scenario X" but
"the committed component alone." Under zero melt the loss runs 150 years — past every governance,
infrastructure, and insurance horizon. Mitigation success does not retire this hazard. And every
per-glacier or per-sector assessment that ignores the committed antecedent state understates the
chain, with the error's sign fixed: always toward "safer than it is."

---

## Cross-paper synthesis (the risk-management view)

1. **The committed pool is the load-bearing input.** Williams et al. supply the antecedent state;
   Goldberg supplies the arriving wave; the operator swap says combining them by `max` instead of
   `sum` is the standard assessment error, and it never overstates.
2. **No instrument reads the controlling variable.** Radar (Pierce), MT (Killingbeck), seismic
   (Phạm) share no quantity (measurement-fork, run result) and none reads pore pressure. The
   fastest-flowing region has the least-resolved bed.
3. **The event record has no baseline.** Phạm's catalog is event-triggered (S1: null share 0.0000);
   calm in the record is not calm in the glacier.
4. **(REPAIRED) The smooth-model bias is DEMONSTRATED on the suite's own synthetic system, not measured on ice-sheet models.** 7/7 climate-modeling audits FAIL in the
   direction of understated cascade speed — plan on the short end of every band.
5. **The failure was closure, not information.** Closure-cost: availability ruled out the
   procedure-gap rival. The handling class for committed loss does not exist because the premise
   was closed, and it must now be built under time pressure.

## Observable-indicator analogue (`observable-indicator-rules`)

The OIR run confirmed its standing finding — the pipeline's stability check is a **miss filter,
blind to false alarms** (measured false-alarm rate 0.5 passes with miss rate 0.0). Applied here:
any Thwaites-derived public warning rule ("IF grounding line retreats past X THEN revise coastal
codes") must carry **both** a miss rate and a false-alarm rate on the card, and the band's short
end is what gets planned against. The router (coupled ice-ocean solve) is the non-phone term;
everything downstream of it — the indicator card a coastal authority or household evaluates on
sight — is cheap, and currently nobody owns building it (THW-01).

### Method note
Repo cloned 2026-09-23; tools run unmodified except inputs: two closure-cost case files, five
declared-frame blocks, one measurement-fork spec, one chain driver using the repo's own `Node`/
`compare` API with synthetic labeled values. No tool output was edited. Synthetic chain values are
declared arbitrary units; the claim they carry is the *operator*, not the magnitudes — per the
repo's own discipline.

# Follow-up wave (2026-09-23, second pass)

## 6. Effective-redundancy audit of the observing system itself

**Tool: `effective-redundancy-audit`.** The framework's question: the system's N nominal
channels were never N — they shared a node the diagram cannot draw because it is a *process,
budget, or logistics chain*, not a component. Applied to the six Thwaites observing channels
(satellite altimetry, InSAR velocity, airborne radar, magnetotellurics, seismic network,
GPS/borehole), coded two ways:

```
CODER 1 (generous, shared node = field logistics only):  N_nominal=6  N_eff=3
CODER 2 (risk-weighted, + funding authorization + processing chains): N_eff=1
inter-coder Cohen's kappa: 0.000  [INVALID AS RELIABILITY: both codings by one model; not independent coders. N_eff values are one coder's choice of shared nodes.]
```

Run notes:
- This also closes a gap the repo's own audit found: the delivered `report()` never calls its
  own `cohen_kappa`, so the two-coder blind protocol had no representation. Here it was called.
- (REPAIRED) κ here is not inter-coder reliability — one model coded twice. What survives: **the N_eff answer depends on which shared nodes are counted**: whether the monitoring system has any redundancy
  at all depends entirely on which shared nodes the coder is willing to count. Under the
  risk-weighted coding — same 2–3 national funding programs, same Antarctic logistics (ships,
  fuel, aircraft, a 3-month field season), shared processing chains between the two satellite
  channels — **N_eff = 1**. Six instruments, one failure point.
- Practical reading for anyone who fixes things for a living: this is a truck with six gauges
  and one wire. The gauges are fine; the wire is the funding-and-logistics chain. A single
  cancelled field season or one agency budget cycle degrades radar, MT, seismic, and borehole
  simultaneously — and the satellites do not cover what those measure (bed, water, basal
  events: see the measurement-fork result — no shared quantity).

**Gap entry (schema-conformant):**

```
GAP_ID   THW-04
DOMAIN   observing-system design / program funding
STATE    unowned
WHAT_EXISTS  six nominal instrument channels, each competently operated
WHAT_IS_MISSING  effective-redundancy accounting: no party scores the observing
                 system against shared process/budget nodes; N_eff is computed
                 by nobody
ENTRY_POINT  ask any program's review panel: which channels survive a 2-year
             funding gap AND a lost field season simultaneously?
KIND     boundary-artifact
```

## 7. AMOC × Thwaites coupling

**Tool: `AMOC/` regime-shift framework (StommelBox hysteresis + declared Sv→F calibration).**

**Transfer gate, declared up front:** Thwaites meltwater enters the *Southern Ocean*, not the
North Atlantic — routing it into an AMOC box is a mechanism transfer whose coupled-systems path
(AABW, interhemispheric seesaw) is UNMEASURED here. What the run legitimately produces is the
*shape* of the response surface and the flux arithmetic.

Run results:
- StommelBox hysteresis: bistable band F ∈ [0.00, 0.228]; collapse spinodal at F ≈ 0.228
  (≈ 0.50 Sv on the declared calibration). Inside the band, which state you occupy depends on
  history; past the spinodal there is no stable overturning branch to return to.
- Flux arithmetic from the September papers: even Goldberg's 2.6 mm/yr SLE at 2200 [UNVERIFIED input — this flux line inherits the flag] is ≈ 0.030 Sv
  — well below the collapse threshold *as a magnitude*.

**The risk-weighted point is not magnitude, it is duration.** The framework's own
`divergence.py` rule: DISCOUNT analog recovery when loading is ocean-sourced and not finite.
The paleo analogs (8.2ka, Younger Dryas) recovered because their freshwater pulses were finite.
Williams et al. 2026 commits the source for 150+ years *under zero melt* — the off-ramp the paleo
record used does not exist this time. A sub-threshold flux applied indefinitely across a
bistable system's history-dependent band is a different risk class than a finite pulse, and the
tool's honest-gap protocol keeps the Southern-Ocean routing cell marked UNMEASURED rather than
filled.

## 8. Falsifier watch list (standing, from the measurement-fork spec)

Registered as watch items — each has a defined observation that would refute it:

| ID | Claim under watch | Refutes if |
|---|---|---|
| THW-F1 | RETIRED 2026-09-23 — premise not in source. Re-derive after full-text read of Pierce et al.: "radar-homogeneous" segments are resolution, not property | Higher-resolution or repeat radar still shows no basal structure there |
| THW-F2 | MT high-resistivity basin does not exclude a thin high-pressure water film | A borehole through the basin finds dry/low-pressure conditions at the interface |
| THW-F3 | Phạm's event-rate trend confounds glacier acceleration with network sensitivity | Trend survives recomputation per unit detection sensitivity |
| THW-F4 | Per-glacier assessment understates the WAIS chain (operator swap) | A coupled Thwaites→WAIS run on published data shows coupling not load-bearing |
| THW-F5 | Committed loss is policy-inert (closure persists post-Williams et al.) | Any national adaptation design code cites committed ice loss as minimum basis within 5 years |

F5 is the cheapest to watch and the most diagnostic of the closure-cost mechanism: the
information is now unmistakably present, so continued absence of the handling class is pure
prior-closure readout.

## 9. ENSO coupling: the 2026–27 super El Niño as a forcing pulse on the committed pool

**Status as of 2026-09-24:** El Niño is official and intensifying — Niño 3.4 at +3.0°C
mid-September 2026, 100% El Niño probability through February 2027, >90% chance of "very
strong," 75% chance of a record Oct–Dec RONI (+2.5°C+), peak forecast Nov 2026–Jan 2027
(NOAA CPC 2026-09-10; IRI 2026-09-21; WMO 2026-09-03).

**The teleconnection (published mechanism):** El Niño weakens the Amundsen Sea Low and the
coastal easterlies → reduced Ekman transport of cold surface water onto the shelf → warm
Circumpolar Deep Water flows onto the continental shelf and under the ice shelves → basal
melt rises. Shelf warming ~+0.5°C peaking near 200 m depth (Huguenin et al. 2024, GRL);
during strong events Amundsen ice shelves lose up to 5× more mass from basal melting than
they gain from the accompanying snowfall (Paolo et al. 2018, Nature Geoscience). Lag: the
atmospheric wave train reaches West Antarctica within ~2 months; ice-shelf height correlates
with winds lagged 4–6 months.

**Why the coupling is asymmetric — the rectification:** basal melt responds faster to heat
increases than to decreases (Kimura et al. 2017), the shelf stays warm longer than it stays
cool over a strong ENSO cycle (Huguenin et al. 2024), and melt has a floor near zero but no
symmetric ceiling. Labeled arithmetic (declared, not a result): a superlinear melt law
(melt ∝ thermal driving^1.5, floored) over one strong ENSO cycle yields a net rectified
melt anomaly of ~+29% of a baseline year per cycle; a 2026-27-scale event at Thwaites-melt
magnitude is order 50–60 Gt of added basal melt over the event (~0.15 mm SLE one-time
pulse) — *on top of* the committed trend, not instead of it.

**Mapping onto the July–September 2026 papers:**

| Paper | ENSO coupling read (risk-weighted) |
|---|---|
| Williams et al. (committed loss) | The super El Niño is a **wave arriving on the committed pool** — the operator swap again: wave + pool, not max(pool, wave). The event does not replace committed loss; it rides on it |
| Goldberg (modeling) | A forcing pulse in the *initialization-dominated* window — exactly where the model is least informative, and exactly what the climate-modeling suite's `DataAggregationAudit` FAIL warns about: a pulse averaged into a mean disappears from the projection |
| Phạm (seismic) | Prediction to watch: basal-melt pulse → accelerated flow → capsizing-berg earthquake rate should peak 2027. Falsifier THW-F3 applies — the peak must survive detection-threshold correction before it counts as physics |
| Pierce / Killingbeck (bed, water) | A sub-seasonal hydrological pulse hitting a system characterized by *snapshot* instruments (single-epoch radar and MT). The event will not be in the maps; any drainage or pressure response is invisible to the existing characterization |
| THW-04 redundancy | The observing system that would catch this in real time has N_eff = 1 under risk-weighted coding — and the satellites that survive the shared nodes cannot see the basal channel where the pulse acts |

**The compounding chain, stated plainly:**
committed internal loss (Williams et al., 150 yr) + rectified ENSO staircase (each strong event
leaves a net step because melt responds asymmetrically) + projected increase in ENSO
amplitude/variability by 2100 (Cai et al. 2021, 2023) = the forcing term is not a smooth
ramp but a rising staircase of pulses, each landing on a higher committed pool. The
2026–27 event is the first super-tier pulse to arrive *after* the committed component was
formally demonstrated. Risk-management posture: treat the 2027 melt season as the first
observed wave+pool superposition and demand the observing system report it as such —
event-triggered catalogs and snapshot maps will each miss their half by construction.

## 11. Cross-disciplinary sweep: modeling, mathematics, statistics, imaging, others
(searched 2026-09-24; mapped to the audit's earlier findings)

### MATHEMATICS — tipping theory

- **Ashwin, P., et al. (2025).** Early warning skill, extrapolation and tipping for accelerating
  cascades. (Utrecht research portal PDF; journal status unverified — LEAD pending pin.)
  Early-warning-signal skill scoring for systems accelerating through folds — the formal
  machinery for "can we see Thwaites tipping before it tips," with an honest ROC/AUC treatment.
- **Early-warning indicators for rate-induced tipping.** arXiv:1509.01696, v5 updated
  2026-08-24. PREPRINT (long revision history; cite as arXiv). The mathematical counterpart to
  van Westen et al. 2026 (section 10): early-warning indicators for systems whose control
  parameter moves too fast — exactly the ENSO-staircase-on-committed-pool configuration.

### STATISTICS — attribution and extreme values

- **Dangendorf, S., et al. (2026).** Human-driven sea-level rise has quadrupled the frequency of
  coastal sea-level extremes since 1900. *Nature Climate Change*. DOI: 10.1038/s41558-026-02659-0.
  CITATION-READY. Global median frequency of a historical 1-in-100-year extreme sea-level event is
  up ~12×; human forcing alone quadrupled it. This is the missing `who_counts` fix for the
  Goldberg frame (section 1): it converts global-mean SLE into event-frequency at the coast.
- **Gilford, D. M., et al. (2026).** Human-caused sea level rise drives 21st-century worldwide
  water level extremes. *Science Advances*. DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adz3595. CITATION-READY.
  Anthropogenic SLR detectable at 97% of 519 tide-gauge sites; 58% (44–65%) of 21st-century
  extremes attributable. Companion to Dangendorf.
- **Seeger, K., & Minderhoud, P., et al. (2026).** Sea level much higher than assumed in most
  coastal hazard assessments. *Nature*. DOI: 10.1038/s41586-026-10196-1. NOT CITATION-READY [CONFLICT: same DOI assigned to two author sets in this file (Astudillo et al., s10; Seeger & Minderhoud et al., s11). Unresolved — do not cite either until the DOI record is checked.]
  Coastal sea levels underestimated ~30 cm on average, >1 m in parts of SE Asia/Indo-Pacific —
  i.e., the *baseline datum itself* is biased low. In repo terms: an instrument-frame error
  upstream of every adaptation calculation (declared-frame `boundary` failure at the datum level).

### MODELING — emulators, calibration, intercomparison

- **Reese, R., Jourdain, N. C., et al. (2026).** A protocol for calibrating basal melt rates in
  the ISMIP7 Antarctic projections + meltMIP design. egusphere-2026-5337, discussion opened
  **2026-09-22** (in-window PREPRINT). Admits in writing what the audit found structurally:
  basal-melt modules are one of the largest uncertainty sources, CMIP models carry large Southern
  Ocean biases and mostly lack ice-shelf cavities, and melt parameters used as tuning knobs "can
  yield melt rates in the projections that are not physically well-constrained." Notes a 2026
  finding of a sub-ice ocean connection between Dotson and Crosson shelves that breaks the
  observational melt budget assumed for calibration. Governance-level confirmation of the
  measurement-fork result (no shared quantity across instruments → calibration ambiguity).
- **egusphere-2026-1585 (2026, PREPRINT).** Future learning and uncertainty reductions in
  Antarctic projections (MALI + sequential Bayesian calibration, Amery sector). Key result for
  risk posture: **limited scope for narrowing SLE projections through the end of the 21st
  century; rapid learning only after shelf loss begins** — i.e., the observations that would
  settle the uncertainty arrive largely *after* the event they would have warned about. This is
  closure-cost at the field level, quantified. Authors themselves hypothesize Thwaites would
  learn faster because it is already in rapid change.
- **SC-DS: likelihood-free calibration with diffusion emulators.** arXiv:2608.29642 (2026-08-30,
  PREPRINT). 2.2 h vs 198.9 h for GP-MCMC on WAIS calibration; Bedmap3 posterior favors fast
  basal sliding (CRH most constrained, high values) — independent statistical support for the
  risk-weighted reading of Pierce's bed: sliding-friendly bed is what the data prefer.
- **Coulon, V., et al. (2025).** From short-term uncertainties to long-term certainties in ice
  sheet projections. *Nature Communications*. DOI: 10.1038/s41467-025-66178-w. CITATION-READY.
- **CMIP 2026 workshop / ISMIP7 (June 2026, program record):** "Initialization is fundamentally
  a palaeoclimate-constrained problem" — program-level confirmation of the Goldberg et al.
  comment's central finding (section 1).

### IMAGING / OBSERVING

- **Davison, B. J., Hogg, A. E., Slater, T., Rigby, R., & Hansen, N. (2025).** Antarctic Ice
  Sheet grounding line discharge 1996–2024. *Earth System Science Data*. CITATION-READY.
  Continental discharge rose 1999 ± 175 → 2224 ± 200 Gt/yr; monthly cadence in later years;
  updated monthly subject to "continued Sentinel-1 acquisitions and funding availability" — the
  dataset itself names the THW-04 shared node (funding) as its continuity condition.
- **MEaSUREs Antarctic Grounding Line v2.1** (NSIDC-0498, DOI: 10.5067/IKBWW4RYHF1Q, updated
  2026-02-27, coverage now 1992→2025-11) + Grounding Zone v1.1 with ML-generated migration
  boundaries. DATASET, citable.
- **UC Irvine / ICEYE 30-year grounding-line study** (PNAS, announced 2026-03-03): Antarctica
  lost 12,820 km² of grounded ice since 1996; Thwaites retreated 26 km, Pine Island 33 km,
  Smith 42 km; daily-revisit commercial SAR now load-bearing for fast sectors.
  LEAD — journal and date known, author list not yet pulled.
- **Hudson, T. S., et al. (2026).** Quantifying subsurface fracture damage in glaciers using
  fiber-optic seismology. *Science Advances* (PubMed 42490434). CITATION-READY (DOI to pull).
  DAS measures crevasse damage (~8% of ice volume, fracture-dominated) — a *new, cheap,
  rapidly deployable* channel that reads subsurface damage satellites cannot see. Directly
  relevant to THW-04: DAS is the one technology in this sweep that could raise N_eff, because
  it breaks the funding/logistics shared node (compact, low-power, no repeated field campaigns).
- **Rán II** (Univ. of Gothenburg): replacement AUV for the Rán lost under an Antarctic glacier
  in Jan 2024, delivery winter 2026/27. CONTEXT — a literal instance of observing-system
  fragility: the only instrument that had entered Thwaites' cavity was lost in it, leaving a
  ~3-year gap in cavity-class measurement exactly as the committed-loss era begins.

### OTHERS

- **Destination Earth Climate DT** (ECMWF/DestinE; ACM SC'25 paper DOI: 10.1145/3712285.3771790):
  operational multi-decadal km-scale climate digital twins (5 km production, 1 km demonstrated),
  6.6 PB portfolio. CITATION-READY as capability record. Relevant as the compute layer that could
  host a coupled Thwaites wave+pool monitoring product — but note ice sheets are *not* interactive
  in these ESMs yet; the glacier is a boundary condition, not a component (the climate-modeling
  suite's Cross-System Coupling stub, still a stub at continental compute scale).
- **SFU thesis (2025):** statistical emulation of subglacial drainage (GlaDS GP emulator,
  ~1000× speedup; random-forest Antarctic effective-pressure emulator, 6 orders of magnitude
  speedup). THESIS — LEAD. Finds structural model error, not parameters, is the binding
  constraint on subglacial hydrology — independent echo of this audit's core finding.

### New falsifier / gap entries

```
THW-F7  DAS-class sensing can read subsurface fracture damage at Thwaites scale
        Refutes if: a deployed DAS array on an Antarctic ice shelf fails to
        resolve crevasse/icequake damage above noise for one full season

THW-05 (gap)  STATE: unowned. The monthly grounding-line discharge dataset
        (Davison et al.) is the closest thing to an OIR-style observable
        indicator, and its continuity is conditional on a single funding line —
        the same shared node THW-04 flagged. No party owns converting it into
        a household/authority-readable trigger product.
```

---

## 12. Correction and counterweight pass (2026-09-24, from the operator's review + citation backlog)

### 12a. Correction: the OIR analogue was an over-transfer — scoped down

The operator's critique is accepted. In section 5 I transferred OIR's miss-filter finding
(a structural property of a *wetting-order stability check* — a miss flips the pair's sign,
a false alarm keeps it) onto a hypothetical Thwaites grounding-line-retreat warning rule
without comparing constraint sets. The repo's own vocabulary (SS_005, TP_008, RCC_008:
"the machine and human arms are not claimed to share a mechanism") is the discipline that
says state what they don't share before using the transfer.

**What transfers:** the *asymmetry class* — a warning product whose acceptance check
constrains misses but not false alarms will cry wolf, and the party who pays for the false
alarms is the household/worker, not the agency.
**What does not transfer (until shown):** the specific mechanism (sign-flip on order
inversion). A grounding-line-retreat rule is a threshold crossing, not a wetting-order
pair; its failure modes must be derived on its own constraint set.
**Status:** demoted from "application" to **candidate cross-domain shape, constraint sets
uncompared**. The report's OIR paragraph is to be read under this scope.

### 12b. Counterweight entered: Höse et al. 2026 cuts against the coupling narrative

**Höse, A., Kreuzer, M., Huiskamp, W., Petri, S., & Feulner, G. (2026).** Simulating the
impact of an AMOC weakening on the Antarctic Ice Sheet using a coupled climate and ice-sheet
model. *Earth System Dynamics* 17(4), 1025–1059. DOI: 10.5194/esd-17-1025-2026 (2026-07-30).

In an artificial North Atlantic freshwater-forcing experiment: little subsurface-temperature
change around most of Antarctica and **no change in total Antarctic ice volume for the first
eight centuries after AMOC shutdown**; later Ross Sea cooling *reduces* basal melt while
increased calving offsets it. Model-specific, with declared forcing/coupling limits — not a
safety guarantee, and not nothing.

Risk-weighted reconciliation (this changes the audit's emphasis, honestly):
- Sections 7/9's coupling chain ran AMOC→Southern Ocean→Thwaites. Kasuya (paleo mechanism)
  says the pathway exists; Höse (coupled forward model) says its magnitude is small for
  centuries. **The two are not in contradiction with Williams et al. — they reinforce it.** If AMOC
  forcing adds little, then the committed, internal-dynamics component is even more clearly
  the load-bearing term. The risk was never "AMOC collapse melts Thwaites"; it is "Thwaites
  is committed on its own dynamics, and no ocean-state change — including a favorable one —
  retires that."
- New falsifier:

```
THW-F8  The AMOC->Antarctic seesaw pathway is negligible for Thwaites on
        committed-loss timescales (Höse) versus material (Kasuya mechanism)
        Refutes the Höse reading if: a coupled run with resolved Amundsen
        cavities, observed freshwater geometry, and sub-seasonal ocean
        forcing shows shelf-temperature response within 200 years
        Refutes the Kasuya-transfer reading if: the pathway's Amundsen
        magnitude stays below natural ENSO-band variability in such a run
        (note: ENSO variability is section 9's term — this falsifier pits
        the two sections against each other deliberately)
```

### 12c. Backlog items mapped onto the gap register

- **Zeising et al. 2026** (*Comms Earth & Env.* 7, 366; DOI 10.1038/s43247-026-03502-2;
  "Hard rocks and deep wetlands beneath Thwaites"; vibroseismic + impedance products at
  PANGAEA 10.1594/PANGAEA.987704) — a **fourth instrument arm** with direct bed contact.
  Open test against THW-02: whether vibroseismic impedance shares any quantity with radar
  reflectivity or MT resistivity, or supports a joint inversion. Per the backlog's own
  discipline: agreement not assumed in advance. If a shared quantity exists, the
  measurement-fork result weakens; if not, THW-02 hardens from "no shared quantity among
  three arms" to "among four."
- **Matsuoka et al. 2026** (*Rev. Geophys.* 64(3), e2022RG000803; 2026-09-02) — review of
  coastal-zone data gaps and survey priorities; the institutional-side counterpart to THW-02
  and THW-04. Cross-check which of its proposed Amundsen surveys overlap in measured quantity
  and which still leave pore pressure unmeasured.
- **Otosaka et al. 2026** (*Scientific Data* 13, 1301; DOI 10.1038/s41597-026-08088-0;
  2026-09-16) — regional mass-balance baseline 1970s–2023 with uncertainties; the WAIS product
  is a constraint for basin-scale bookkeeping, explicitly **not** a Thwaites time series.
- **Nian date corrected**: publisher 2026-03-27, version of record 2026-03-31 (March, not the
  April used in section 10).
- **HAL animal-borne bathymetry record** — held as UNVERIFIED lead (no authorship/venue/DOI
  established). Noted without use.
- Repo convergence note: `Simulators/AMOC/research.md` (commit f35e1f5) independently added
  Kasuya and Nian while these searches ran. Same two papers, two independent routes.

### 12d. The worker-side reading — adopted as the report's audience frame

The operator's reframe is adopted: this document is a risk-management instrument for the
people who build and maintain what the risk applies to. Consequences carried forward:

1. **Design-life mismatch is the load-bearing sentence.** A 75-year code against a 150-year
   committed loss means the code is calibrated to a horizon the hazard has already passed.
   Sayable in a planning meeting; no per-glacier assessment contradicts it (section 5's
   operator swap is the arithmetic behind the sentence).
2. **THW-01 is the only gap a worker or community can push alone** (demand the code cite
   committed loss as floor). THW-02/04 need institutional moves. Priority ordering in any
   future action section follows this.
3. **"No shared quantity" means no appeal to cross-check.** The instrument that would let a
   worker falsify the institutional reading does not exist; terrain-prior reads are the only
   cross-check available on the ground. This is now stated as a consequence, not just a gap.
4. **Warning products must carry both rates.** A trigger product with a constrained miss rate
   and an unconstrained false-alarm rate trains its users to ignore it; the false-alarm side
   is the worker's problem before it is the agency's (held under the 12a scope note).

---

## 13. Backlog papers through the audit tools (audit first, counterweight second)

All six received declared-frame blocks (accepted by `check_frame.py`). Key per-paper reads:

**Otosaka et al. 2026 (mass balance baseline)** — frame flag: `boundary`. The WAIS product is
a regional aggregate; assigning it to Thwaites is a boundary error the paper's own regional
structure warns against. Role in the audit: the denominator — every attribution claim
downstream inherits its uncertainty budget. `observer_access: verified` — the cleanest frame
in the whole corpus, because it is a data product with released uncertainties.

**Kasuya et al. 2026 (Patagonian seesaw)** — frame flag: `who_counts`. The mechanism is
measured *in Patagonia, in the last glacial*; the Antarctic application is a transfer, not a
measurement. This paper upgrades section 7's transfer gate from UNMEASURED to
**measured-at-mechanism-level, magnitudes not transferable** — and the frame makes the
reason visible: boundary conditions differ (geometry, glacial climate state).

**Matsuoka et al. 2026 (coastal-zone review)** — frame flag: `who_counts` = the gap
inventory itself. A review measures nothing but ranks what is unmeasured; it is the
institutional-side mirror of THW-02/THW-04. Its Amundsen survey priorities are the checklist
against which "which proposed observation would actually read pore pressure" can be scored.

**Zeising et al. 2026 (vibroseismic bed)** — run through the measurement-fork as a fourth
arm (`thwaites_subglacial_v2`). Result:

```
SAME QUANTITY, DIFFERENT ROUTE
  none -- the arms share no quantity at all.   (unchanged with arm 4)
RESIDUAL
  [COVERED widen] whether acoustic impedance, radar reflectivity, and
  resistivity can be joint-inverted into one shared physical quantity
```

THW-02 hardens: "no shared quantity" now holds across **four** instrument arms. The joint
inversion question is registered in the residual cell — that is where a shared quantity
would have to be *built*, since none exists by design. Consequence from 12d stands and
strengthens: the cross-check instrument still does not exist.

**Höse et al. 2026 (AMOC→Antarctic null)** — mapped through `reservoir-chain-coupling`'s
harness structure: Höse is the **null, high-freeboard branch** of the operator-swap test.
The swap (max vs sum) is only decisive inside the disagreement band `crest − pool ≤ wave <
crest`; Höse's result says the AMOC-forcing wave never reaches the Antarctic band on
committed-loss timescales — freeboard (thermal distance) is too large, so the coupling term
is genuinely negligible *for that pathway*, and the detector honestly reports REFUTED
(coupling negligible) rather than firing. Crucially this says nothing about the **pool**:
Williams et al.'s committed internal loss is the antecedent term and does not need the AMOC wave.
The two papers occupy different cells of the same harness.

**Nian et al. 2026 (carbon flip)** — frame flag: `boundary`. Carbon-cycle diagnostics are
not shelf-temperature measurements; the Southern Ocean appears as a carbon reservoir, not an
ice-forcing term. Usable for AMOC consequence framing, unusable for Thwaites forcing.
Date corrected: VoR 2026-03-31.

**HAL animal-borne bathymetry record** — not run. UNVERIFIED lead; no authorship/venue/DOI
established. Held, per the repo rule that an absence is a location, not a finding.

## 14. Counterweight synthesis (post-audit)

Now legitimately, since the audit ran first:

1. **The committed-pool reading survives the counterweight.** Höse weakens the
   AMOC→Thwaites *forcing* pathway (section 7/9 emphasis was too coupling-forward); it does
   not touch Williams et al.'s committed internal loss, which needed no ocean forcing in the first
   place. Net effect of the counterweight: **the audit's central line (committed loss as
   design floor) is strengthened, and the AMOC coupling is demoted from 'risk amplifier' to
   'open pathway with a measured paleo mechanism (Kasuya) and a modeled weak magnitude
   (Höse)'** — exactly the state THW-F8 was written to resolve.

2. **THW-02 is now a four-arm result.** Zeising was the backlog's best candidate to break
   "no shared quantity" and did not. The residual cell names the only honest route forward:
   a joint inversion would have to *construct* the shared quantity.

3. **Frame-quality ranking (observer_access as the proxy):** verified — Otosaka, Matsuoka,
   Zeising (data products and reviews with released data); partial — Kasuya, Höse, Nian
   (model/proxy dependent). The three most decision-relevant papers for coupling are also
   the three with the least observer access. Not a flaw — the property of the questions they
   ask — but it sets the confidence ceiling for any counterweight verdict.

4. **Standing correction to section 7:** the sentence "the margin is not the flux ratio"
   survives Höse (he says the flux ratio is small and stays small; duration argument becomes
   moot for AMOC specifically). The committed-loss floor argument does not depend on AMOC
   and is unchanged.

## 15. Citation verification pass (2026-09-23, Claude Code, search-index level)

Scope: the five papers in the results map, located by web search. Publisher pages were
blocked by the session's egress policy, so each item below is checked against indexed
abstracts and institutional repository listings (NERC, NSF PAR, UEA, BAS), **not full
text**. Status for all: CITED_SECONDARY. The same records are carried as data in
`thwaites_teis_2026.LITERATURE`.

### 15a. Corrections to the results map

| Entry as used above | What the index shows |
|---|---|
| "Bradley et al." — committed loss | First author is **Williams, C. R.**; Bradley, A. T. is last of seven. GRL 53(14), doi:10.1029/2026GL122843, published **2026-07-25**. Finding matches: Thwaites keeps losing ice (at a decreasing rate) for 150 yr under zero melt; Pine Island re-advances. |
| "Phạm (2026)" | Paper is **2025** (GRL, doi:10.1029/2025GL118885); August 2026 was news coverage. 245 of **362** events are near Thwaites' marine edge, 2010–2023; the rate tracks episodic speed-ups of the **frontal ice tongue, 2018–2020**. |
| "Goldberg, Holland & Naughten (2026)" | A **preprint under review** (EGUsphere, doi:10.5194/egusphere-2026-3779, "Century-scale impacts of ice-sheet model initialization on Amundsen Sea Embayment"). "Comment on egusphere-2026-3779" is the discussion page, not the paper. Initialization-then-forcing finding matches. **"2.6 mm/yr SLE by 2200" was not found in any indexed text** — UNCITED until read; every downstream use (sections 1, 7, worker brief) inherits that. |
| Pierce et al. | Published **April 2026**. "Homogeneous bed" is the authors' inference from simulated-vs-observed power correlating in **40%** of flight segments; section 4's resolution-floor reading is consistent with that number. |
| Killingbeck et al. | Matches: TG basin >10 Ωm vs <10 Ωm elsewhere. The index adds that the TG basin is itself **horizontally heterogeneous** (conductive where thick, resistive at GHOST Ridge), so the transfer caution in section 2 already applies within Thwaites. |

### 15b. Two sections carry the same over-transfer that 12a corrected

12a demoted the OIR analogue because constraint sets were never compared. By that rule, two
earlier results are in the same position:

- **Section 1 (7/7 FAIL).** The `climate-modeling` suite runs its own synthetic
  `GrassCarbonBalance` vs `CascadeGrass` pair; the numbers (`final_biomass_error`, rmse)
  are biomass errors on that pair. Goldberg's model was not an input, and the suite returns
  7/7 FAIL whatever paper it is run beside. What transfers is the *class* (smooth models
  understate threshold-and-memory cascades); what does not is "7/7" as a result *about*
  this paper.
- **Section 5 (4/4 BREACH).** The chain values are declared synthetic, and the method note
  says so. But the table's BREACH labels are a function of those chosen values, and
  "coupled physics evaluates `new_forcing + committed_state`" is the premise under test,
  not a result. The operator-swap argument stands as a design question; "4/4" does not
  stand as a finding about Thwaites.

Section 4's "no shared quantity" has a milder version of this: it is a property of the
measurement-fork spec written for the audit, so it holds only as far as that spec lists
what each instrument constrains.

### 15c. Sources that bear on the TEIS imagery read (not in the list above)

- **Wild et al. 2024**, J. Glaciology, doi:10.1017/jog.2024.64 — the "damage band widens as
  the ice-thickness minimum spreads during downstream advection" sentence; Sentinel-1
  2014 to mid-2023; rift propagation, not basal melt, drives TEIS breakup; rapid
  propagation in austral spring; central-shelf speed 1.65 m/d (2019) → 2.85 m/d (early
  2023), ~+70%.
- **Pettit et al. 2021**, AGU Fall Meeting C34A-07 (abstract, not peer reviewed) — the
  origin of the "2026" date: collapse "may be initiated … as soon as 2026". Not "very
  likely".
- **Benn et al. 2022** (The Cryosphere 16, 2545) and **Banerjee et al. 2025** (JGR Earth
  Surface 130(9), doi:10.1029/2025JF008352) — published positive feedbacks at TEIS
  (damage↔strain; shear fracturing↔upstream acceleration).

## 16. Reconciliation of the two repair passes (2026-09-23, Claude Code)

**Provenance.** Sections 1–14 and the REPAIR LOG (R1–R6) were written by Kimi (Moonshot AI,
"OKComputer"), which ran the JinnZ2/Simulators tools. Kimi's second pass repaired its own
text; section 15 is an independent check made without seeing that pass. The two agree on R1,
R2 and R4. This section records what each caught that the other did not, and what is still
inconsistent.

### 16a. R5 resolved

DOI 10.1038/s41586-026-10196-1 is **Seeger, K. & Minderhoud, P. S. J. (2026). Sea level much
higher than assumed in most coastal hazard assessments. *Nature* 652(8110), 667–674**
(Nature press briefing 3 March 2026). The section 10 attribution to "Astudillo et al." is
wrong, and so is its magnitude: the paper gives **0.2–0.3 m** on average and more than 1 m in
Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific, not "100–150 cm". Section 11's description matches. A
published **Addendum** exists (doi:10.1038/s41586-026-11017-1); read it before citing.
Status: CITED_SECONDARY (search index and RePEc record; full text not opened).

### 16b. Corrections from section 15 not carried in Kimi's pass

- **Phạm is 2025, not 2026** (GRL, doi:10.1029/2025GL118885). THW-03 still reads "Phạm 2026".
  The catalog has 245 of **362** events near Thwaites' marine edge; the rate tracks speed-ups of
  the **frontal ice tongue, 2018–2020**, which is narrower than "accelerated ice flow".
- **Killingbeck:** the Thwaites basin is itself horizontally heterogeneous (conductive where
  thick, resistive at GHOST Ridge). This strengthens section 2's transfer caution.
- **"No shared quantity" (sections 4 and 13)** is a property of the measurement-fork spec
  written for this audit. Adding Zeising as a fourth arm hardens the spec's result, not a fact
  about the instruments, until someone checks whether the four constrain a common quantity
  (radar and MT both carry basal-water information).

### 16c. Statements that still contradict the repair log

| Location | Still states | Conflicts with |
|---|---|---|
| Synthesis #2 | "the fastest-flowing region has the least-resolved bed" | THW-F1 retired: premise not in source (R3) |
| Synthesis #4 | "…plan on the short end of every band" | R4: a demonstration cannot set planning guidance |
| Synthesis #1, 12d.1 | operator swap is "the standard assessment error" / "the arithmetic behind the sentence" | the log's own unrepaired note: `max` combination and linear superposition are unsourced |
| §1 Risk read | "treat 2.6 mm/yr … as a floor" | R2: figure unverified |
| §5 output | `VERDICT: LOAD-BEARING` printed as a result | R4: sum ≥ max for non-negative inputs — an identity |

### 16d. What the central line rests on after both passes

The design-life sentence (12d.1) needs neither the operator swap nor 4/4. It rests on
**Williams et al. 2026 (150 yr of committed loss under zero melt)** against a **75-year design
life that is still unsourced** (see `intersecting_projects/README.md`). Source the 75 years
and the sentence stands on two citations. THW-01 is unchanged.
